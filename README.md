# Eyeshot Web Service
The Eyeshot Web Service is a secure hosted service that provides access to Eyeshot engine in the cloud. The hosted service allows content to be passed via a SOAP or REST API interface.

EWS was designed to take advantage of Eyeshot engine capabilities from any platform. It can be used to generate high quality images from a list of CAD files, to prepare geometry for 3D printing, to build quotes based on the part geometry, to check if a manufactured part is within tolerance and much more.

Currently can be used for:

1. Generate raster images from uploaded geometry
2. Perform bidrectional conversion between STL, OBJ, DWG/DXF, IGES and STEP file formats
3. Reposition (Translate, Rotate, Scale) geometry
4. Get drawing or assembly structure
5. Get all geometry circles

What we plan to add:

1. The ability to check the uploaded geometry against a number of 3D point generated by a CMM
2. The ability to compute geometry area and volume
3. The ability generate a 360 degrees number of raster images
4. The ability to get all the cylindrical surfaces in the geometry
5. The ability to upload a point cloud and get a 3D mesh
6. The ability to do 3D modeling by a scripting language
7. The support for ASC and LAS point cloud
8. The ability to build a 3D model from MRI or TC scans
9. The ability to enumerate specific entities in the drawing
10. What you ask most

Please [send us feedback](mailto:support@devdept.com) on what else you may need.

You can find EWS API reference [here](http://documentation.devdept.com/ews/webframe.html).

EWS is currently in Beta and free.
